# Career-Readiness-Multi-Agent-system
It is my first multi agent AI system that evaluate student's career readiness using Gemini 2.5
This is my first end-to-end AI Agentic project.
It evaluates a student's career readiness using multiple agents:

🔹 Agent 1 — Profile Collector
Extracts structured JSON from raw text.

🔹 Agent 2 — Readiness Evaluator
Scores skills, projects, DSA, academics (0–10 scale).

🔹 Agent 3 — Gap Detector
Identifies where the student must improve.

🔹 Agent 4 — Roadmap Generator
Generates a 7-day personalized improvement roadmap.
